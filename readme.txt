Turns your WordPress installation into a simple caching proxy.

== Description ==

I built this plugin to help ease the transition during a DNS changeover, but you can use it any way you please. It turns your WordPress installation into a very simple proxy server. It fetches content from another URL, caches it and displays it. Requests are cached for 24 hours.

Install the plugin, then head over to Settings > Simple Proxy in your WordPress admin. Enter the URL you want to proxy to and when you're ready to go, also check the enabled checkbox.

You need to have [pretty permalinks](http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks#Choosing_your_permalink_structure) enabled.
